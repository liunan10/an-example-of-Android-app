# Game Introduction
This game tests your reactions time. When the game starts, a red square box will move from box to box. 
The speed of movement of the box will increase as the game keeps going. You can stop the movement when you think the red box has moved onto
boxes with large value. The last score is the cumulative values you got. Just be careful when you stop the movement, because some boxes 
in the playground contains value "0", which will reset your score to 0! Have fun!
